**Welcome to Open Saber**

The goal of open saber is provide source code, circuit diagrams, and
documentation for making an Arduino (and compatible) based lightsaber.
The focus is on the internals of the saber, not how to build the case.

Why? For the joy of the problem, working together, and learning / playing
with Arduinos. There are certainly commercial solutions to saber electronics,
but if you want to build and contribute to the code and internals, this site
is for you!

Making a lightsaber is fundamentally a lot of simple things (the combination
of which creates complexity) fitted into a small space (which creates a
design challeng.) As a warning, it's probably impossible to build a saber
for less than you can buy one, unless you already have the tools and
relevant experience.

The information and documentation assume a basic knowledge of Arduinos,
electronics, soldering, etc.

There have been several design approaches:
1. Discrete breakout boards chained together.
2. Custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with through hole components
3. Custom PCBs with SMD components

It is too difficult to follow the docs if the past versions are included;
therefore, this doc only covers the current approach. This uses custom
PCBs and SMD components. I don't think there's a practical way to solder
SMD components without using flow soldering in a (relatively cheap) toaster
oven. Many components are actually easier to place with SMD, but I do
find it challenging to solder ICs (the accelerometer in particular)
reliably and ofter have to "fix up" a board with an SMD heat gun.

The Open Saber site / repo is 3 things:
- Overview of the (electrical) design of a saber.
- Source code for blade ignition, color, sound, etc. that runs on
  arduino class micro-controllers.
- Documentation & circuit diagrams for circuits and components.

An Open Saber electronics in action here: https://youtu.be/9_-Rfe4UBJM.

## Features:
- Support for 3 LED RGB "any color" saber
- Flash on clash
- Simple motion and impact detection
- Sound font support
- Constant (average) current to LEDs, so that color & power stay constant
  with battery level changes
- Battery level tracking and indicator
- Command set to adjust saber setting from a computer
- Recharge port / kill key port
- SPI support for secondary display, etc.
- Dotstar support for UI, etc.
- Support for displays (SmartLED, 7-Segment, matrix)

## Status & Direction

There are over 5 working sabers on the OpenSaber design with cases
by SaberZ, UltraSabers, TCSS v1, and SaberForge ASP.

The version number - as much as it is consistent - references
the PCB board. The PCB board is called a "shield" because it sits on top
of a Teensy Microcontroller.

I use the largest possible SMD components to make it as straightforward
as possible for a human to solder. They are still *small*.

Generally speaking the PCB shield sit on a Teensy 3.5. You can also use a
Teensy 3.2, but you need to connect an SD card on the SPI interface.
(The 3.2 does not have an integrated SD card.) There is work in progress
to support the Adafruit Itsy-Bitsy.

OpenSaber puts the resistor for the emitter LED on the PCB board; this
is somewhat non-standard, but there is space for it, and it's much more
space efficient and reliable to have the resistors on the PCB vs. packed in
the front of the saber somewhere.

Note that many commits to the github repo are parts for a 3D
printer. While you are welcome to use them, the focus of
this site is the electronics, which can be re-used from saber
to saber. The physical parts are unique to each saber (unless
you use a standard case, of course.) I've recently generalized the OpenScad
code for the 3D printer so if someone starts to use that it can be
documented.

## Alternate Approaches

- http://www.rocket-props.com/the-open-source-saber-project uses some
  interesting ideas, including SMD componends and using buck-pucks.
  Nice approach, very different from this one.
- The Teensy Based Lightsaber http://fredrik.hubbe.net/lightsaber/
  has a similar electrical design, some innovative features, and
  doesn't use a PCB. (Which has pros and cons.)

## Architecture

An overview of the parts of a saber. Technically speaking, to organize your
 electrical thoughts, a saber is a *very* fancy flashlight.

In roughly front to back order, an saber is:

1.  A **blade holder**. (1" is standard.)
2.  A **lens** to focus the LED. The lens is bought to match the LED,
    and narrower is usually better.
3.  3 **LEDs** in the 1-Watt each range. Red, green, blue, and
    sometimes white or another color. I like both the Luxeon and Cree XPE-2.
    You generally buy '3-up' configuration which has a Red, Green, and Blue
    LED on a heat conducting die.
    (I haven't experimented with the 12W LEDs yet; electrically
    most of the designs should handle it, but the power from the battery
    and the cooling are potential issues.)
4.  A **heat sink** for cooling the LED. Often part of the saber body.
    TCSS provides them as well. LEDs are kept to 350ma - 400ma each (although
    you can change this.) Many LED's, if cooled correctly, can take
    considerably more power. Conversly, many sabers with poor heat sinking
    fail over time as their LEDs burn out.
5.  **Power and Auxillary** switches (momentary on, typically 12mm). The
    code supports both a one button version and a two button version. Both
    versions support the same features except "clash sound" which is only
    supported in the 2 button version. If the switches have LED rings, the
    microcontroller will use them for power / volume display. (Note that the
    one button configuration is much more common and better supported.)
6.  **Electronics**. Please see the full discussion below.
7.  **Power port**. Typically 2.1 mm. If plugged into a Li-Ion charger,
    charges the battery (and disconnects the microcontroller). If a kill key
    is inserted, turns off the saber.
8.  **SD Card**. A simple SD card breakout board or integrated card. This is
    where the sound fonts are stored. Note that the saber code WILL NOT work
    without sound fonts stored and named properly on the MicroSD card. Also,
    if using the Teensy 3.5, the SD card is integrated.
9.  3.7v Li-Ion **battery**. TCSS and Adafruit both sell good, small,  long
    lasting batteries. Need something rated 2000mAh or better. Amazon as well
    carries protected Li-Ion batteries. (The Panasonic NCR18650B 18650 has
    been recommended.)
10. **Speaker**. TCSS and Adafruit carry them, as well as Mouser and Digikey.
    (I've had a lot of inexpensive speakers arrived damaged from China, so I
    do recommend a reputable supplier.)

## Wiring

FIXME new wiring diagram

### LEDs

LEDs are used in a bunch of places. Specific concerns are discussed
below, but for all the LEDs it's good to have a handly calculator.
The Vf comes from the LED data sheet. The Vsource depends on
which circuit it is connected to.

A LED calculator: http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz

This calculator will select the next higher standard resistor,
which is almost always what you want. However, if you want to
calculate the exact resistance:

R (ohms) = (Vs - Vf) / amps_through_led

Specific LED usage:

- The "emmitter LED" is the high power LED that lights the blade.
  Powered by the battery
  at 4.2 to 3.5 volts. Typcially about 1 Watt
  (or higher) per channel, and the resistors are typically 1 Watt.
  Typically a Vf of about 3.0 and expects 350mA of power. But
  get correct values from the datasheet! Generally has a resistor
  of 1-4 ohms. Note that once you select an LED, and add the
  resistor and specs into the `pins.h` file, the microcontroller
  will use PWM to keep the power at the specified level (or less.)
  This means you can sometimes round down on the resistor values:
  for example, if the `perfect` resistor is 1.6 ohms, and the
  calculator recommends 1.8 ohms, you might use a 1.5ohm to give
  the microcontroller a little more "range" to work with.

- LED indicator lights, usually on the buttons. Powered at Vcc,
  3.3 volts, stable from the microcontroller. In theory these
  often take 20mA, about a 47 ohm resistors. But that is BRIGHT.
  I often use 470 or 1000 ohm resistors.

- DotStar smart LEDs. Used for user indicators. (Power meter,
  volume, etc.) Driven by the prop shield, requires no resistors.
  In general, once you need one RGB indicator light, it's more convenient
  and space efficient to switch to smart LEDs.

### Power Bus

The saber uses a common ground. There are (potentially) 4 positive power
voltages. Please be aware of the power supply. Shorts between the supplies
can cause big issues. It's very important to not "cross" the power supplies
or use the wrong one.

- Vbat, the battery power supply. Ranges from about 4.2 - 3.5V. Vbat delivers
  a *lot* of power, up to about 1A (1000mA) to the audio and LEDs. It also
  powers the micro-controllers.
- Vcc, a 3.3V, regulated, constant, low-amp supply. Powers the switch LEDs and
  other indicators. Vcc is provided by the microcontroller. Note that,
  generally speaking, Vcc does not provide enough power for smart LEDs.
- SmartLED / Dotstart / Neopixel. SmartLEDs often have their own power.
  One solution is to use a booster, and run them at 5v. Another approach
  is to run them at the battery power. In any case, the PCB should (and does)
  set the control & clock line power to match the battery. I generally find
  it's easier, and works just fine, to run the SmartLEDs at battery power.
  But it's important to keep aware that the logic level (and possibly supply
  power) of the SmartLEDs differ from the rest of the system.
- USB. When the saber is plugged into USB, there is Yet Another power supply.
  WARNING: it is VERY easy to short a Teensy by plugging in a standard USB
  cable. This causes a short between the 5V USB power supply and the 3.7V
  Li-Ion battery. This will destroy the saber. Your options:
    - Cut the USB power on the Teensy board. I don't recommend this; it
      seems much too easy to "reconnect" via a short (metal dust?) or
      thermal expansion. I've burned out 3 microcrotrollers due to
      mysterious issues when connecting USB.
    - Cut the power (red) line in the USB cable. Much more reliable...but
      you must *always* use the modified cable. I mark the cables with red
      tape.

#### Power Port
Convention, and the current design, uses a 2.1mm recharge jack. Wiring of the
jack is such that:
1. the battery charges when the charger is plugged in
2. the circuit is dead when there is a non-conductive kill key plugged in
3. the circuit is live when nothing is plugged in, which is also
   indicated by the ring LED if you use that type of momentary switch.

This is useful, and convention for almost all saber designs, but a little
weird. For it to work (safely) for case #1, the grounded sleeve of the recharge
port should be isolated from "true ground" and the case of the saber. You need
to be careful with a metal port, or use an insulated plastic one.

#### Power Suppy: 3.7v Li-Ion

Sabers run off 4 AAA, 3.7 Li-Ion, or 7.4 Li-Ion. OpenSaber is designed
around a 3.7 Li-Ion.

Why?
- Rechargable
- Smaller than 7.4v, the size is competitive with AAA
- Efficient for resistors on LEDs. A typical LED forward voltage is 2-3 volts,
  so overall efficiency is about 80%.
- Buck/Boost converters make the 7.4 supply less interesting for the
  microcontroller and DotStars.

Note that the actual battery voltage varies significantly (from 3.5 to 4.2V)
and the control circuit accounts for that.

### Electronics

The electronics are the heart of the OpenSaber project. The files are
ExpressPCB files. I regret the proprietary solution, but I've been happy
thusfar with the service.

The shield - which is the PCB that sits on top of the Teensy - collects
together 1) an audio amplifier, 2) a DotStar LED controller,
3) an accelerometer, and 4) and emitter LED power onto one board. It also
provides an SPI inteface connection for an external SD card, display, or
similar.

- A **microcontroller**, the Teensy 3.5, is the micro-computer
  that runs the software. It controls the blade state, the color
  of the LEDs, the color of the blade, and does audio processing.

  It is soldered to a shield PCB. The microcontroller
  can be programmed directly via USB. The 3.5 includes an integrated
  SD card.

- **LED amplifier** The LED uses a 3 channel, 350ma (configurable) controller.
  The microcrontroller uses an amplifier bridge made of 3 MOSFETS
  to drive the LEDs. Voltage monitoring is used to keep the LED current
  constant. You may change the LED current in the software.

- **LED** a 1-2 W Cree or Luxeon LED in a star configuration is typical.
  The LED uses a common anode, as well as 3 control lines: Red, Green, and
  Blue. They 4 wires are connected from the LED to the front side of the
  emitter electronics.

### Switches

The code supports 1 or 2 switches. At this point, the one switch
configuration is much more tested.

#### One Switch

Tap selects mode: "ready", "palette", "volume". Press-and-hold ignites
the blade or changes the setting.

#### Two Switch

- A: the main switch. Hold for power, tap for battery level indicator.
- B: the auxiliary switch. When the blade is on, tap for "blaster effect",
  hold for "lockup effect". When the blade is off, hold to toggle sound.
  When the sound turns on, hold for 1-4 flashes to set volume.

### Audio

Audio playback is integrated into the main micro controller. It takes
44.1kHz in; you will need to convert files to 44.1k. They are typically
*not* 44.1kHz when provided, so you will need to convert.
- http://www.foobar2000.org/
- http://www.huelix.com/audio-converter/

You can have up to 10 sound "fonts" or sound banks. Each font
needs to be in its own sub-directory, which will be the name of the font.

All the names can be postfixed with a number for random variation: `SWING` or
`SWING01` for example. Note that the card / code is limited to 8.3 filenames.
You can't mix names in a group; using both BLDON and POWERON in the same
sound font will confuse the sound output.

- "BLDON", "POWERON" blade ignition
- "BLDOFF", "POWEROFF" blade retraction
- "IDLE", "HUM" the background drone
- "IMPACT", "CLASH" is the sound of impacting another saber
- "MOTION", "SWING" is the basic saber motion sound
- "USRHOLD", "LOCKUP" is a user defined long sound, typically the sound
  when 2 sabers are held together.
- "USRTAP", "BLASTER" is a user defined short sound, typically the sound
  of parrying blaster fire.

## Code

The code is really the heart of this project. The code
is set up to compile in the Arduino IDE, using the Teensyduino extension.

First you will need to set up libraries. Then you need to configure
you particular saber in "pins.h".

### Libraries

I feel guilty about every forked library; but it's hard to
work around API issues. These are minor forks, at least.

#### Accelerometer

The current design uses the (really great) LIS3DH.
https://github.com/leethomason/Adafruit_LIS3DH

#### OLED

The OLED display is required to compile, although it isn't supported
as part of OpenSaber yet. (I use it in a personal saber.)

https://github.com/leethomason/OLED_SSD1306

### Config Files

#### 'pins.h'

'pins.h' contains the wiring pinout, documentation, and features switches.
The tricky #define is the SERIAL_DEBUG macro. If on, you can connect
the USB header and debug the saber. However, without a USB connection, **the
saber won't work if SERIAL_DEBUG = 1**. The serial port won't be found,
the timeouts kick in, and the saber essentially "locks up". It's a great to
be able to debug, but remember to SERIAL_DEBUG=0 and upload that sketch
when you are done.

Pins contains a bunch of other macros, which you can disable when you
build the saber, and turn on one by one.

'pins.h' also contains the description of the LED: forward voltage,
resistor values, etc. You need to set this for your particular build.

Note that there is an equation for UVOLT_MULT which controls the volt
meter. There's some variability; once the saber is assembled, I suggest
adjusting this value by checking computed vs. measured values. (Type 'vbat' on
the command line to get the current computed value.)

##### "Constant Current" and tuning the voltmeter.

The OpenSaber code will maintain an average of 350mA current
(or whatever you specify) across the LED. This block of code in pins.h
is important for tuning:

````
  static const int32_t UVOLT_MULT = 6680;
  #define ID_STR "Gecko (Sentris Body) RGB Luxeon"

  static const int32_t RED_VF   = 2900;   // milli-volts
  static const int32_t RED_I    = 350;    // milli-amps
  static const int32_t RED_R    = 2400;   // milli-ohms
````

VF: forward voltage, from the LED spec.
I: milli-amps of power
R: the resistor value you used

And finally the UVOLT_MULT. It's a little tedious to calculate,
and doesn't turn out to be useful to do so. Once your saber
is up and running, wait until it hits the 3.7 volt range.
Measure the power with a voltmeter. Run `vbat` on the saber
command line to get the measured value. Adjust UVOLT_MULT,
and recompile.

UVOLT_MULT' = UVOLT_MULT * V_measured / vbat

And then re-check the `vbat` just to be sure. It should
be close, but doesn't need to be exact.

### Command line

If you connect via USB, you can open the COM port to the saber and
issue commands. Do this by opening the Serial Monitor and entering
comminds in the terminal that appears. This works irrespective of
SERIAL_DEBUG.

The saber has 8 palettes. The palette is a combination of:
- blade color
- impact color
- sound font

- `bc` will return the current blade color for current palette. `bc #rrggbb`
  will set the blade color for the current palette. It will also show the
  current power draw of the color. I generally keep it at 1000mA or less,
  although you could theoretically draw about 1/2 the batter capacity. Do
  keep in mind how well your LED is able to sink heat.
- `ic` gets / sets the impact color or "blade flash".
- `pal` returns the current palette. `pal <0-7>` sets the current palette.
- `font` gets/sets the sound font in use.
- `fonts` lists the available sound fonts.
- `vol` and `vol <0-204>` gets and sets the current volume.
- `vbat` is the current battery level, in milli-volts. 4200 is fresh, 3700 is
  nominal, 3500 is low. This is read from the Vmeter of the emitter circuit.
- `util` is the current utilization of each channel. It is computed from Vbat.
  `90 90 76` means that the saber will use 90% red, 90% green, and 76% of
  the blue channel. This keeps the average current through the LED constant.
  When Vbat drops to 3.7V, these will all be 100%.
- `pwm` is the current Pulse Width Modulation of the red, green, and blue LEDs.
- `mot` and `mot <1.1+>` gets and sets the threshold, in g-force, that
  the saber will detect as motion, and play the motion sound effects.
- `imp` and `imp <1.1+>` gets and sets the threshold, in g-force, that
  the saber will dectect as impact, and play the impact sound effects.
- `stat` will display all of the current saber settings.
- `reset` will reset the palettes to their default values.
- `accel` prints the current accelerometer output. Useful for checking
  calibration and that your axis are set up correctly.
- `test` runs the saber test suite.
- `play` plays a sound on the SD card. You need the full name:
  `play demichel.wav` or `play bespin2/hum.wav`

## Future Direction

In practice I've found that there are two drivers to the design:
- Size. Smaller electronics leads to more features that can be packedd into
  theh saber. I try to balance size with ability to be soldered and
  wired up.
- Features for sabers. With every saber I build I put in some new or
  novel feature. (Although sometimes this is in the case, not electronics.)
  But those changes and improvements are reflected here
